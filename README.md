# Front-End Compiler
 An assigned project from my compiler class. This project covers the Lexical Analyzer, Syntax Analyzer, Semantic Analyzer, and the Intermediate Code Generator.

## Summary

 A **compiler** is a program that translates source code into object code for a target machine.

The source code is written in a high level language like Python, C++, or JavaScript.

The source code contains symbols that have names of variables, functions, types, classes, and etc.

The object code is executed on whoever's machine (target) and generates assembly code as an output from the compiler.

In this picture, the symbol table holds information about source code. When the source code is compiled, it will have to go from the *Lexical Analysis* to the *Target Code Generation*. Finally, the machine (hardware) will consume the object code which it will understand your source code.

## Installation

To run my code just:

```
sh run.sh
```
